## **Repository related rules**

<br>

- All codes are written by Python + `Pytorch`.
- All codes include only core parts (e.g. model only) for simplicity.
- All models MUST have input parameter 'n_classes' to specify the number of output classes and reject others. Others should be defined  with default values. 
- Accordingly, all models should be able to declared in this form. e.g. "model(n_classes=10)"
